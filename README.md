Quran, the holy book of Islam, is recited by an enormous number of reciters around the world, each having their own unique voice and way of reciting. 

Naturally, listeners to Quran prefer some reciters over others. And often, when listening to Quran radio station or to a Quran recitation clip posted on social networks, the reciter is not referenced. We might like his recitation and would like to listen to more of his recitations, but we do not know who he is.

To tackle this issue, I developed this model which is designed to take a five seconds recording of any recitation and tell who is the reciter.

The algorithm was tested on recitations of 50 different reciters and proved its ability to predict the correct reciter more than 86% of the time.
